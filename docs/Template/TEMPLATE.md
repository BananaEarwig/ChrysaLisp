# Template

The `Template` application is a simple demo GUI application that you can copy
and work from as a starting point for your own applications.

If you hover the mouse over the embedded UI below you can see the kind of
features available. There are more features available through the key bindings
which can be found in the `KEYS.md` documentation.
